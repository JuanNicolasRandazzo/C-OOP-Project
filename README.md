<H2>Generated Numbers:</H2>
<p>This first option displays two lotteries. The user can choose between either of the two, and a new Form will be generated where they can play the lottery by generating random numbers and saving them in a text file, which, if the user wishes, can be read.</p>
<br>
<H2>Conversions:</H2>
<p>In this second option, there are also two different options: "Money Exchange" and "Temperature Convert." If the user chooses Money Exchange, a form will be displayed where different types of currency can be converted. Similarly, the results will be saved in a text file, and the user can read them if desired.</p>
<p>Choosing the Temperature Convert option, the user can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Like in the previous form, the results can be viewed in a text file.</p>
<br>
<H2>Simple Calculator:</H2>
<p>In this third option, the user can use a simple calculator in which basic mathematical operations can be performed: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.</p>
<br>
<H2>IPv4 Validator:</H2>
<p>In this last option, the user will see a form with three buttons: "Validate," "Clear," and "Exit." The user can validate any IP thanks to a Regex integrated into the code.</p>
